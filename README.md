## 📋 Overview

The **NIFTY 50 Forecasting System** is a state-of-the-art AI application designed to predict NIFTY 50 stock prices for the next **7 days**. Built with a hybrid Deep Learning architecture, it leverages advanced **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to analyze potential market trends with high precision.

This system provides a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface, allowing traders and analysts to visualize forecasts, compare different model architectures, and even retrain models on live market data instantly.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Live Forecasting**: Real-time data fetching using `yfinance` to provide the most up-to-date predictions.
- **🔮 7-Day Recursive Prediction**: Generates a multi-step forecast for the upcoming week.
- **🧠 Hybrid Model Support**:
    - **Seq2Seq LSTM (Encoder-Decoder)**: Optimized for sequence generation, creating smoother and more accurate multi-day forecasts (Recommended).
    - **Multivariate LSTM**: Considers multiple technical indicators for complex analysis.
- **⚡ Online Learning**: Optional feature to **retrain** the model on the latest available data before generating predictions, ensuring adaptation to recent market volatility.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: "Weather Card" style UI for intuitive price trend visualization (Up/Down indicators).

## 🛠 Model Performance

We have evaluated multiple architectures to ensure the best performance. The **Seq2Seq LSTM** is the currently recommended model due to its superior stability in multi-step forecasting.

| Model Architecture | RMSE Score | Description |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Seq2Seq LSTM** 🏆 | **~228.00** | Encoder-Decoder architecture best suited for sequence-to-sequence problems. Captures temporal dependencies effectively. |
| **Multivariate LSTM** | ~1083.22 | Uses 13+ technical indicators. While powerful, it can be more sensitive to market noise in short-term volatility. |

> **Note**: The Seq2Seq model currently outperforms the standard Multivariate approach by approximately **80%** in terms of RMSE on our validation set.
